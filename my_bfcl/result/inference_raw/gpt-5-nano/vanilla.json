Since the user didn't specify, I\\u2019m thinking it might be safer to set traffic to false to avoid unpredictable results. However, users often prefer current traffic information. Generally, including traffic gives a more accurate estimate. But, if there\\u2019s any ambiguity, I should ask the user for clarification.\\n**Preparing function call for distance**\\n\\nI need to call a function to get the travel distance and duration between two locations using parameters.

Instead, I\\u2019ll focus on calling the tool right now. Once the tool returns results, I can present the final answer in a natural language response later. This is the usual structure for using tools: I call the function first, and then in the next message, I respond with the crafted answer. I just need to follow the rules and make the function call!\\n**Executing the tool call**\\n\\nIn this scenario, I need to make the function call right now to get the necessary data. Then, once the system provides the tool's output, I\\u2019ll respond with the final answer in natural language. This is the typical order of operations for using tools, so it\\u2019s straightforward.
