So, if it's 3 PM in New York, it should be 8 PM in London on the same day. However, depending on daylight saving time boundaries, the difference might still shift around 7 to 8 hours. If it were standard time, London would be at 10 PM. Overall, London\\u2019s time can alternate between UTC+0 and UTC+1 based on the season.\\n**Preparing timezone conversion**\\n\\nThe time difference is consistently 5 hours, meaning that 3 PM in New York corresponds to 8 PM in London, regardless of daylight saving time, as long as we're on the same day.
