Time to compute!\\n**Finalizing compound interest calculation**\\n\\nI\\u2019ve calculated ln(1.0125) as approximately 0.012422526. When I multiply that by 40, I get about 0.49690104. Now, e^0.4969 gives me around 1.643. So, if I multiply that by 1000, I\\u2019m looking at an approximate final amount of $1643. However, to confirm, I want to compute (1.0125)^40 more precisely.

I need to clarify the parameters for using the tool effectively.\\n**Exploring musical scale functions**\\n\\nI\\u2019m considering calling the \\u201cmusical_scale\\u201d function for the A# minor key with the \\\"natural minor\\\" scale type, although I'm unsure if that will be accepted since the parameters are fuzzy.
