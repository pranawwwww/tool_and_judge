However, the instruction indicates there are multiple materials like marble, terracotta, wood, and stone. So, I should focus on providing these enumerated options to the user.\\n**Determining the right function call**\\n\\nI\\u2019m considering the constraints here. Instead of using a non-existent tool in a parallel call, I should opt for the sculpture_create_custom function with the parameters for a horse sculpture in bronze, size 12.

I need to ensure that my final output adheres to the instruction: only the function call should be returned, not any additional text.\\n**Deciding on the function call approach**\\n\\nIn this situation, I realize the instruction states I should only return function calls in my responses. The first step must include the function call, and while I\\u2019d typically follow up with a natural language message, that's not allowed here. I think the best route is to use the sculpture_create_custom call, but that may not fully address the user's request for options.

I could consider using a painting function, but that's irrelevant. Instead, I\\u2019m settling on calling sculpture_create_custom with the parameters: item \\\"horse,\\\" material \\\"Bronze,\\\" and size 12. This aligns with the user\\u2019s request for a bronze sculpture. However, the instructions limit me from presenting any results beyond this function call, which feels restrictive.

But there's this issue with the default parameter for permeability being 0.01, which doesn\\u2019t seem physically correct. It might refer to relative permeability instead of the typical permeability in free space. I should double-check and follow the instructions while considering this aspect of the function.\\n**Calculating magnetic field parameters**\\n\\nThe user asked me to calculate the magnetic field using the function `calculate_magnetic_field`, which requires inputs for current, radius, and permeability. I see that the default permeability is noted as 0.01. Since the user didn\\u2019t provide a specific value, I\\u2019ll use that default. My current is 5, radius is 4, and permeability is 0.01, so I'll compute B using the formula B = permeability * I / (2R).
