So, the structure would be something like: {\\\"recipient_name\\\": \\\"functions.get_museum_hours\\\", \\\"parameters\\\": {\\\"museum_name\\\": \\\"The Metropolitan Museum of Art\\\",\\\"day\\\": \\\"Saturday\\\"}}. I want to be careful about the formatting and might shorten \\\"The Metropolitan Museum of Art\\\" to \\\"The Met\\\" for clarity.\\n**Crafting museum hours request**\\n\\nThe user asked for \\\"\\u5927\\u90fd\\u4f1a\\u827a\\u672f\\u535a\\u7269\\u9986,\\\" which translates to \\\"The Metropolitan Museum of Art,\\\" or \\\"The Met\\\" for short.
