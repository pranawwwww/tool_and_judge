Alternatively, I can use the kinematics_calculate_speed_from_rest function, which calculates speed for an object starting from rest under constant acceleration. I know the distance is 20 and time is 4, but there\\u2019s some confusion about the function's details.\\n**Calculating final speed**\\n\\nIf I set distance to 20 meters, time to 4 seconds, and initial speed to 0, I\\u2019m trying to compute the final speed after traveling that distance with constant acceleration.
