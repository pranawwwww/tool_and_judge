However, the function doesn\\u2019t accept a list parameter.

If I call sculpture_create_custom for each material, it might show what's allowed and respond with an order preview. I think my best move is to use multi_tool_use.parallel to call it for materials like Bronze, Marble, Terracotta, Wood, and Stone, while setting the item to \\\"Horse\\\" and size to 12.

While the user has chosen Bronze, they asked for material choices, which could mean they want alternatives too.\\n\\nEven if they want to explore options, calling all five materials will show those choices. However, this may create an order placeholder, which could confuse them since they asked for options, not an immediate purchase. The function outputs could show material options, helping them see where they can choose and confirming that they have different materials available, including Bronze.
