However, the user didn't clarify whether it was AM or PM, which makes me think I might need to ask for clarification. But, I also have to check the instructions that say if the question lacks parameters, I should point that out. I can call the conversion function with \\\"3pm\\\" as time, which I think is a safe assumption. So, I'll proceed with calling functions.timezone_convert with time \\\"3pm\\\" from \\\"America/New_York\\\" to \\\"Europe/London\\\".\\n**Analyzing time zone differences**\\n\\nThe user asked about converting 3 PM New York time to London time. I think converting this would show 8 PM BST in summer. So, New York, being UTC-5 or UTC-4 with daylight saving, and London at GMT+0 or BST UTC+1, creates different offsets depending on whether daylight saving time (DST) is in effect. Currently, there's a four-hour difference when both regions are observing DST, meaning if it's 3 PM in New York, it\\u2019s 8 PM in London.\\n**Clarifying time zone conversions**\\n\\nIn 2024, Daylight Saving Time (DST) starts in the US on the second Sunday in March, while the UK changes on the last Sunday of March. This creates a one-week period where New York is UTC-4 and London is UTC+0, leading to a 4-hour difference. So, when it\\u2019s 3 PM in New York, it becomes 7 PM in London.
