First, I squared 1.0125 to find 1.02515625, then squared that to estimate 1.050. I also considered using the natural logarithm method, knowing that (1+r)^n can be approximated through e^{n ln(1+r)}. After calculating ln(1.0125) and multiplying, I get e^{0.4969}, which is close to e^0.5, leading to a final approximation of about 1.642.\\n**Computing with series expansion**\\n\\nI'm working through computing e^0.4969 by breaking it down into e^{0.4} and e^{0.0969}. From my calculations, e^{0.4} is about 1.4918247, and for e^{0.0969}, I estimate it using a series expansion. I add the terms together to get roughly 1.101746 and multiply it by 1.491825 to find that it\\u2019s close to 1.644. Now, I\\u2019m planning to use a tool for precise calculations, ensuring I have the correct parameters for the function.\\n\"}, {\"type\": \"function_call\", \"name\": \"financial_compound_interest\", \"arguments\": \"{\\\"principle\\\":1000,\\\"rate\\\":0.05,\\\"time\\\":10,\\\"n\\\":4}\", \"call_id\": \"call_EoC0qXGOEoUpDMrT54TflmEd\"}]}"}

The documentation states it defaults to the current season, which is 2024. Since \\\"season\\\" is optional, I can choose to omit it or set it to 2024. The tool needs a JSON format, so it must include required fields \\\"team\\\" and \\\"league\\\". I think I\\u2019ll go ahead and include \\\"season\\\" as 2025 just in case.\\n**Setting up function call**\\n\\nThe default season is 2024, but since the current date suggests it should be 2025 or possibly 2025-26, I think it\\u2019s safer to omit the season and get the current one instead.
