I wonder if I can use a function to get around this, but I can't find a tool to list materials. Using \\\"sculpture_create_custom\\\" with a default item like \\\"Horse\\\" and material \\\"Bronze\\\" could work, but it wouldn't really answer the user's request for options. Since the instructions insist on pointing out missing parameters instead of just making function calls, that seems to be the best route.\\n**Navigating response limitations**\\n\\nThe user is asking about material options, but they haven't provided the necessary parameters for the function. Although the guidelines say I can\\u2019t provide text responses, I wonder if I could use a function to reflect the error. But since that option isn't available, I\\u2019m stuck.
