It looks like the intended way is to use `calculate_average`, but I\\u2019m stuck since the parameter is missing. The user provided numbers, but there's no way to pass them directly. I could consider whether passing numbers as parameters might work, but that might not adhere to the tool's specifications. So it seems best not to call the function and instead inform the user that we need the data.\\n**Evaluating function constraints**\\n\\nI\\u2019m thinking about how we're restricted to using function calls. The user asked for John\\u2019s average score based on four grades: 90, 75, 82, and 89. I calculated that the average is 84. However, the developer instructions specify that we can only return function calls without providing an answer directly. I wonder if I could call `calculate_average` using a wrapper, but it may not allow parameters since the tool's spec lacks a parameters field, making it unclear if I can proceed that way.\\n**Assessing tool limitations**\\n\\nI\\u2019m thinking about whether I should call `calculate_average` and include a payload with scores, like {scores: [90,75,82,89], subject: \\\"John\\\"}. It\\u2019s tricky\\u2014the function doesn\\u2019t specify parameters, but the tool might evaluate the input. The instructions emphasize only using valid parameters based on the tool's specifications, and since `calculate_average` has none, I shouldn't attempt to call it. The safest route seems to be not calling the tool and stating that the question lacks the required parameters, although I can respond verbally since the instructions allow that.\\n**Deciding on function calls**\\n\\nI\\u2019m considering the situation where I need to compute the average of John's scores, but I can't really use those specific numbers unless they\\u2019re stored. The system likely expects me to perform the calculation myself, but the developer instructions clearly say I can\\u2019t provide direct answers and must use function calls. My best bet is to call `calculate_average` without any parameters. I think I can invoke it with empty parameters, ensuring I follow the right channel for the call.

The schema suggests that the function has no parameters, but I still need to supply a JSON object. The invocation could be either `functions.calculate_average({})` or just `functions.calculate_average()`, depending on formatting. I think I\\u2019ll go with an empty parameters object in the call, which follows the general API design.
