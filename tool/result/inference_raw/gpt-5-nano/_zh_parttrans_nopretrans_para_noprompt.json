During daylight saving time, New York is UTC-4 (EDT) and London is UTC+1 (BST), which means when it\\u2019s 3pm in New York, it\\u2019s 8pm in London. Wait, I need to double-check this. Since London is five hours ahead of New York during daylight saving, that makes sense. But in standard time, 3pm in New York corresponds to 8pm in London too, just UTC-5 to GMT.\\n**Calculating Time Differences**\\n\\nI\\u2019m figuring out the time difference between New York and London. When New York is on Eastern Standard Time (UTC-5), 3pm there means 8pm in London (GMT, UTC+0). So it\\u2019s a consistent 5-hour difference. Even when New York shifts to Eastern Daylight Time (UTC-4) and London to British Summer Time (UTC+1), it seems like the difference remains 5 hours for most of the year. However, there might be brief periods where the difference is 4 or even 6 hours due to different DST schedules.\\n**Understanding Time Differences**\\n\\nI'm looking at the time difference between Eastern Time and London Time, which can fluctuate between 4 to 5 hours based on daylight saving time (DST) alignment. Typically, in winter, there's a 5-hour difference with London at UTC+0 and Eastern Standard Time at UTC-5. In summer, when both areas use DST, it's still 5 hours apart. However, when only London is on BST and not New York, it creates a 6-hour difference, meaning 3pm EST would be 9pm in London.\\n**Handling Time Zone Conversions**\\n\\nI\\u2019m considering the time difference between London and New York. When London is at GMT (UTC+0) and New York is on daylight saving (UTC-4), the difference is 4 hours. For example, if it\\u2019s 3pm EDT in New York, that converts to 7pm UTC. I see that the common standard reference is that 3pm in New York is 8pm in London. To avoid any manual errors, I should just use the timezone conversion function for this. So, I\\u2019ll call functions.timezone_convert with the appropriate parameters!\\n**Preparing Function Call**\\n\\nI'm looking at using a single function call to convert the time from New York to London.
