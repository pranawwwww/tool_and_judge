The tool should provide information based on those parameters. Although I wonder if we might call it twice: once to check if it's closed with closed_status set to true and once with false. The instructions say to verify the details, but I find the tool's requirements a bit unclear. I'll explore possible approaches here.\\n**Choosing function parameters for case check**\\n\\nI need to decide how to call the function `functions.lawsuit_check_case` with case_id 1234, using closed_status as either false or true. The instruction to \\\"check its status\\\" suggests I should return details about whether the case is closed. If I pass false, it could return the case details, but if it's closed, maybe I'd get a mismatch or error. I wonder if setting closed_status to true is the best choice to verify closures. I'll need to choose wisely!\\n**Clarifying function parameters**\\n\\nThe developer's instructions are clear: I need both case_id and closed_status for the function. I have case_id 1234, so I need to choose the closed_status value. While I could initially set it to false, that just asks for details about a case that's already open. It seems better to use true to verify if it's closed.

It might filter based on the closed_status, although it\\u2019s a bit ambiguous. I could also consider using `multi_tool_use.parallel` to call the function twice with different statuses, but that seems overly complicated. It makes sense to just call it once with case_id 1234 and closed_status set to true. This way, I should get details if the case exists and is closed. I'll stick to this approach for clarity!\\n**Navigating function call instructions**\\n\\nI see that I need to focus on the instructions, which say to return only function calls in my response. The usual flow involves calling the function, receiving a result, and then presenting that result in a final message to the user. However, since the instruction emphasizes returning just function calls, I think I should proceed with calling `functions.lawsuit_check_case` with case_id 1234 and closed_status true. After that, I will wait for the tool's result to process and present it correctly.\\n**Executing function call**\\n\\nI realize the final message needs to come after I receive the tool's result, but I can\\u2019t be sure of the order. So, following the usual pattern, I'm going to make the function call now.
