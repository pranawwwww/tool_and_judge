After the system responds with the tool's output, I'll provide a final answer. However, instructions say to only return function calls in my response, which is confusing. In previous tasks, I'd call the function and then provide a final answer after receiving the tool's response. Yet it seems like I should focus solely on calling the function for now.

So, I\\u2019ll focus on calling the tool first, and then once I get the hours from it, I can plan the next step. Typically, I would call the tool, receive the result, and then provide a final answer. However, given the strict instruction, it seems I really should limit my response to just the function call, without any follow-up text afterward.\\n**Deciding on answer delivery**\\n\\nI\\u2019m thinking about how to deliver the answer. The pattern suggests I should make a single function call to get the hours, and then I'll receive the tool's result in the next turn. Typically, I'd provide the final answer in natural language after that. But the directive states to only return function calls in my response, which is a bit confusing. It seems like I need to stick to just the function call for now and then provide the answer afterward.\\n**Proceeding with function call**\\n\\nI can't really predict what will happen, but the standard approach is to perform the tool call in my message. After that, once the tool returns, the next message from me would be the final answer. So, I\\u2019ll go ahead and call the function get_museum_hours with Saturday.

However, there are many proteins found there. I need to ensure my response aligns with the instruction to use function calls. The appropriate tool seems to be `cellbio_get_proteins`, specifying \\\"plasma membrane\\\" as the cell compartment. Since the user is asking for a singular name, I should consider how to best format my request for the function. It's a bit ambiguous, but I\\u2019ll figure it out!\\n**Fetching plasma membrane proteins**\\n\\nI can still call the tool to get proteins located in the plasma membrane, but since I can only return function calls, I'll proceed with `cellbio_get_proteins`. The user asked for \\\"the name of the protein,\\\" which isn't specific, but examples could include \\\"AP2,\\\" \\\"integrins,\\\" or \\\"ion channels.\\\" I think it makes sense to set `include_description` to false just to get the names. So, I'll call the function with the parameters: {cell_compartment: \\\"plasma membrane\\\", include_description: false}.

After the tool provides its output, I know I need to present that information to the user. Typically, in previous tasks, I've shown the tool's results before responding with a final answer. However, the instruction here is clear: I can only include function calls and shouldn't add any explanations or answers. I might have to handle this in steps, using the function call and then finding a way to relay the final answer afterward.\\n**Understanding function call restrictions**\\n\\nI think I should call the function first and then present the final answer afterward. However, there's a clear instruction that states only function calls can be included in my immediate response. It looks like I can chain responses: the function call now, and then follow up with the answer later. Still, the guideline emphasizes no additional text or explanations in the function-call response, which makes me wonder how this process is supposed to work here.\\n**Planning two-step approach**\\n\\nAlright, I think I can take a two-step approach: first, I call the function, and then when the tool returns, I provide the final answer.
