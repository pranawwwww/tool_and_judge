It's a bit confusing, but I\\u2019ll stick to the guidelines!\\n**Clarifying response structure**\\n\\nI think the expected answer here is to solely output the function call, while the function's response will be used later. In past tasks, I've typically followed up the function call with a natural language response, but this time it's restricted to just the function call. The system will execute it and return some data.
