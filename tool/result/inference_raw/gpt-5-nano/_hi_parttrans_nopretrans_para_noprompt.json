The instruction specifies that if no functions can be used, I should acknowledge that. We do have an ordering function, but it doesn't help with questions about material options. I could consider a parallel approach, creating multiple \\\"sculpture_create_custom\\\" calls for different materials, but that would result in actual orders instead of just retrieving options, which feels awkward and unintended.\\n**Deciding on function usage**\\n\\nThe user is asking, \\\"What material options are available?\\\" The materials are listed in the function spec, but I wonder if I should call no function at all. However, since the instruction says I can only return function calls, I can't just provide text. I can't fail to use a function either.

But since E# is enharmonically the same as F natural, this can get messy.

In Lydian, the 4th degree is raised, which fits with C# major's Lydian on F#. \\n- Mixolydian (5th mode) starts on G#: G#, A#, B#, C#, D#, E#, F#, G#. \\n- Aeolian (6th mode) begins on A#: A#, B#, C#, D#, E#, F#, G#, A#, which is A# natural minor. \\n- Locrian (7th mode) starts on B#: B#, C#, D#, E#, F#, G#, A#, B#, but since B# is enharmonically C, I\\u2019ll just refer to it as C Locrian.\\n**Planning scale retrieval**\\n\\nI'm gearing up to retrieve musical scales related to C# major.
