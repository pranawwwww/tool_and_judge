I\\u2019m considering that I might need to omit the deck field to use the default safely.\\n**Analyzing deck requirements**\\n\\nThe JSON type indicates that the deck is a required parameter formatted as { rank: string, suit: string }[]. However, the multi_tool_use has limitations. In similar cases, I should pass the deck as omitted to use the default. I can consider creating a standard 52-card array, which seems lengthy but possible. Since I only need the Queen of Hearts, passing a deck with just one card might fail. The instruction states that the default deck will be used if not provided, so it feels safer to omit the deck.\\n**Deciding on function call structure**\\n\\nThe tool call must include required fields, but it seems the system might allow missing optional fields.
