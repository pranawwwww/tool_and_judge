My instinct is to say that none of the functions can list materials, but I\\u2019m not allowed to ask for more information.

That could fulfill their request nicely!\\n**Creating the sculpture order**\\n\\nI\\u2019m ready to create the order for the custom bronze horse sculpture since the user already specified that material. I think it'll be best to call the function `sculpture_create_custom` with the parameters item set to \\\"horse\\\", material as \\\"Bronze\\\", and keep the size as 12 to be safe.
