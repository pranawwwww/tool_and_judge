However, they haven't asked me to place an order yet; they want to know about material options. So, I can't place the order just yet. I should inform them that material options for sculptures are limited to Bronze, Marble, Terracotta, Wood, and Stone.\\n**Navigating function call restrictions**\\n\\nI'm in a bit of a dilemma with the explicit instruction to only return function calls. Given this precedence, I\\u2019d normally stick to text responses, but that wouldn't follow the rules. I wonder if I could ask a clarifying question through a function, but that wouldn't work either. My options feel limited since I can\\u2019t just return non-functional calls, and creating a call using an impossible material seems like a last resort to check if anything's allowable.\\n**Navigating function call challenges**\\n\\nI feel I need to respond by pointing out that none of the functions can be used, but the instructions say that isn't allowed. That\\u2019s tricky! The instruction to return only function calls is quite strict, yet there's that earlier mention about indicating when functions can\\u2019t be used. I'm considering whether I could call multi_tool_use.parallel with an empty array. Even though it's technically a function call, it might imply that no tools are used. But I can't add any additional fields. That\\u2019s a bit of a puzzle!\\n**Evaluating response options**\\n\\nI think the tool result might end up being irrelevant, and since the user wouldn\\u2019t see any text, it feels risky. I could ask for confirmation to create the sculpture in bronze and provide the material options, but that wouldn\\u2019t work either. Usually, I\\u2019d provide material options directly from the function schema, but that goes against the instruction to only return function calls. I wonder if I could create a \\u201cdummy\\u201d order with each material option, but that doesn't feel right. Plus, since the user asked in Hindi, I should ideally respond in Hindi too, but again, the tool constraints complicate that.\\n**Choosing to respond in Hindi**\\n\\nI'm deciding to provide the material options in Hindi, but the developer's instructions emphasize using tools. Since there\\u2019s no tool to utilize, I\\u2019ll point out that we can\\u2019t use any functions. This creates a contradiction since I\\u2019m supposed to only return function calls.
