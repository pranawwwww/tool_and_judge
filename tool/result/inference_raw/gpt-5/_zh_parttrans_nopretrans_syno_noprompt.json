However, asking for clarification isn\\u2019t allowed since the instructions say to return only function calls. Since we don\\u2019t know how the tool handles nonexistent columns, I\\u2019ll take a cautious approach. I could create a backup first, then try to delete all three: \\u2018email,\\u2019 \\u2018ssn,\\u2019 and \\u2018social_security_number.\\u2019 If I get an error, I might just try again with the surviving column names.\\n**Planning database backup and deletion**\\n\\nFirst, I realize I need to see the result of the first function call in order to adapt my next steps. I can attempt to delete the columns 'email,' 'ssn,' and 'social_security_number.' Ideally, if the function can handle this, it should succeed. However, since I can\\u2019t ask the user to confirm the column names, I\\u2019ll create a backup first. I also need a backup location, which the user didn\\u2019t specify. A reasonable default could be \\\"/backups/employees_personal_data.bak\\\" with a timestamp.\\n**Evaluating file system assumptions**\\n\\nI realize I shouldn\\u2019t make assumptions about the file system for the backup. The function requires a path, so I could set a relative path like \\\"./backups/employees.bak\\\" with a timestamp. However, the user didn't explicitly ask for a backup, and it is not mandatory, merely a best practice. To match the user's request, I could directly proceed with the delete operation instead. I still have the column ambiguity between 'ssn' and 'social_security_number.' It might be wise to delete both simultaneously or make two separate delete calls.\\n**Finalizing deletion calls**\\n\\nI\\u2019m considering that if the deletion of 'ssn' fails, we might still get an error, but we have a second call available. To be straightforward, we could perform three separate delete calls for 'email,' 'ssn,' and 'social_security_number,' but without an \\\"IF EXISTS\\\" flag, this might just cause unnecessary errors. Since the exact column names are ambiguous, the best path seems to be executing a deletion for both potential columns together. \\n\\nSo, I\\u2019ll call functions.database_modify_columns with the database name \\\"employees,\\\" the table \\\"personal_data,\\\" and the operation \\\"delete\\\" for those columns.
