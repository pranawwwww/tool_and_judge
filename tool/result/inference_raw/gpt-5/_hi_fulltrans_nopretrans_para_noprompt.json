The schema specifies that a genre is needed, but the function might still be able to search across any genres. There\\u2019s a bit of a mismatch with the instructions and how the function is set up. To be safe, I'll select \\\"Action\\\" as a default genre. Even though it might limit results, it\\u2019s still an acceptable choice to proceed with.\\n**Determining function parameters**\\n\\nI need to ensure that the parameters for the function are valid. Since passing an empty string isn't allowed, our options become a bit limited. I can't ask the user for a specific genre without returning a text question, but it seems reasonable to call the function with a broad genre like \\\"Action.\\\" The user probably didn't emphasize genre anyway.

Typically, I'd need to provide a final answer, which feels like a conflict with the guidelines. I should invoke the appropriate tool to find the game; after that, it seems I can make another message. Since the genre wasn\\u2019t specified, using parallel queries for all possible genres might be a good approach to gather results.\\n**Using parallel tool functions**\\n\\nSince I can only return function calls, I realize the multi_tool_use.parallel allows me to use multiple tools simultaneously.
