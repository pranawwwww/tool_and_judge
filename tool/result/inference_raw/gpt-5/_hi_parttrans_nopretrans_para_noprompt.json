I could call the function to get both the C# major scale and the relative minor, using \\\"minor\\\" for the calls.\\n**Considering musical scales**\\n\\nThe tool might accept \\\"minor\\\" as a scale type. I see modes such as \\\"ionian\\\" for C#, \\\"dorian\\\" for D#, and so on, up to \\\"locrian\\\" for B#. The function needs both a key and a scale type, so I could call for those specific modes. It makes sense to also include harmonic and melodic minor scales related to A# minor, the relative minor of C# major. The user's question seems to ask which scales are associated with C# major, which I'll definitely clarify.\\n**Clarifying scale relationships**\\n\\nThe typical answer would include C# major's diatonic modes and its relative minor, which is A# minor.

We should cover the following: C# major scale notes as the primary focus, the relative minor A# natural minor, and the modes derived from C# major: Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, and Locrian.

While E# and B# might be unusual, they are technically correct within the context of C# major. If the tool doesn\\u2019t accept E# or B#, I could consider using enharmonic equivalents like F and C instead.\\n\\nTo ensure clarity, I will list the function calls as follows: for C# major, A# minor, and each derived mode, potentially adjusting the notes if needed. In addition, I'll include C# minor as a parallel minor. I'll also consider including major and minor pentatonic scales since they are commonly associated, though I'm not certain if the function supports them. Using multi_tool_use.parallel will let me handle several calls simultaneously, so the user receives comprehensive results about the scales related to C# major.\\n**Planning scale calls**\\n\\nI\\u2019m going to focus on a moderate subset of scales related to C# major.
