The user didn\\u2019t provide the closed_status parameter, which is odd. Should I call with both values instead? But the developer specifies only to return function calls, leading me to think a message about the missing parameter would be necessary. However, since there's no tool for follow-up questions, I might need to try using multi_tool_use.parallel to check both closed statuses instead.\\n**Deciding on function calls**\\n\\nThe tool requires the closed_status parameter to verify details, and I'm wondering if I should call it in parallel with both values. However, the function might return different outputs based on that value, which complicates things a bit. Given the guidelines, it seems I should call the function with closed_status: true first. If there's a mismatch in results later, interpreting those outputs could be tricky. Still, I have to stick to returning just the function calls now.\\n**Determining the lawsuit case status**\\n\\nI should decide how to call functions.lawsuit_check_case with the case_id 1234. There's a bit of uncertainty on whether to set closed_status to true or false. Since the user specifically asked if it\\u2019s closed, I think starting with true makes sense.

If a question lacks parameters, I should point this out, but without adding any text. It seems the best plan is to attempt using the tool directly, as it will provide details about the actual status while requiring a boolean for closed_status. I can't pass null since the schema specifies a boolean.\\n**Implementing parallel calls**\\n\\nI\\u2019m thinking about whether to choose false for closed_status, but that feels risky. Instead, I can use multi_tool_use.parallel to call functions.lawsuit_check_case twice\\u2014once with closed_status set to true and once to false.
