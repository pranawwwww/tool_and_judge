The tool could return a mismatch. I wonder if we might need to call it twice since we only have one tool available.\\n**Considering function calls**\\n\\nI'm thinking about whether we should call the function twice with `closed_status` set to true and false to see the results. However, the instruction states we should only return function calls. I could use `multi_tool_use.parallel` to run both calls simultaneously, but is that really necessary? Alternatively, I could just pass `closed_status: true` by default. Since the user is unsure, checking both options seems like the most reasonable way to avoid any assumptions.\\n**Determining parameter requirements**\\n\\nI'm considering that maybe the tool returns the status regardless of the boolean passed and uses it for validation. However, to be safe, the instruction indicates we should point out if the question lacks required parameters, and the only missing one here is `closed_status`. It seems it is indeed required by the function, but can we proceed without it? Should I ask for clarification? The instruction says we can\\u2019t include any text, but how do I point it out if I can only return function calls?\\n**Navigating conflicting instructions**\\n\\nThe developer's instructions say that if none of the functions can be used, I should point that out, but they also state that I should only return function calls without any other text. This creates a conflict: how do I \\u201cpoint it out\\u201d? It seems we shouldn\\u2019t call any function if parameters are missing, but then what do I return? I could choose a default value for `closed_status`, but this would mean verifying \\\"not closed.\\\" To be thorough, I could run the function twice in parallel: once with true and once with false.\\n**Deciding on function calls**\\n\\nThe tool might produce two different verifications, but I\\u2019m reminded that the system will handle reading the results. I still need to make the function calls. Using `multi_tool_use.parallel` allows running multiple tools simultaneously, even if the prompt suggests doing it sequentially.

The schema indicates three fields with no \\\"optional\\\" designation, yet many frameworks allow omitting the genre. It looks like it's required according to the type, but maybe we can use a generic option instead. I\\u2019ll double-check that before proceeding.\\n**Deciding on genre filters**\\n\\nThe user didn\\u2019t specify a genre, so I\\u2019m thinking about whether to select \\\"no filter\\\" by choosing all options. The tool might expect filtering by genre, but if I pick arbitrarily, it could limit results. Leaving it unspecified could default to no genre, although a checker might raise a flag. Alternatively, I could call multiple genres in parallel using the multi_tool_use.parallel method. Still, the developer instructions say to only return function calls, so I need to find a balance.\\n**Choosing genre for game search**\\n\\nThe description states that the default is an empty string, so I think it might be safer to include a genre\\u2014perhaps \\\"Action.\\\" However, that could limit the user's preferences since they didn't specify. An alternative would be to run parallel calls for all five genres, which would help in finding a multiplayer game while providing a broader selection. The user asked for \\\"one\\\" multiplayer game, but I wonder if it's better not to specify a genre at all. The function can\\u2019t support no genre, but using \\\"Action\\\" as a fallback could be acceptable.\\n**Navigating parameter requirements**\\n\\nThe developer instructions indicate that if the question lacks necessary parameters for the function, I should point it out. This raises a dilemma because while the tool documentation states that the default genre is an empty string\\u2014which implies it\\u2019s not required\\u2014the type suggests it is. Should I adhere to the developer's directive about pointing out missing parameters? However, I can\\u2019t include plain text. It\\u2019s a bit tricky because I must return only function calls without extra explanations.\\n**Using function calls properly**\\n\\nI need to ensure that if I invoke any functions, I strictly use the provided tools. However, there\\u2019s a conflict because while it\\u2019s important to point out missing parameters, I can only return function calls. The best workaround might be including a default genre, like \\\"Action.\\\" But if the schema requires a genre, I can\\u2019t omit it. Alternatively, I could run five parallel calls for each genre using multi_tool_use.parallel with the platform set to \\\"Windows 10\\\" and a rating of 4.5. This way, I can aggregate the results effectively.
