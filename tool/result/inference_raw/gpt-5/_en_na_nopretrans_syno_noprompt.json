{"id": "multiple_105", "result": "[{\"type\": \"reasoning\", \"content\": \"**Calculating magnetic field**\\n\\nI need to use a function tool to calculate the magnetic field. The tool, calculate_magnetic_field, has parameters like current, radius, and permeability. The default for permeability is set to 0.01, which is a bit odd because the actual value is typically 4\\u03c0 \\u00d7 10^-7 H/m. The user provided a current of 5 A and a radius of 4 meters, so I'll call functions.calculate_magnetic_field with these inputs while omitting the permeability parameter to use the default. I hope this approach works!\\n**Verifying magnetic field formula**\\n\\nI realize the formula for the magnetic field is B = \\u03bc0 I / (2R), with \\u03bc0 being 4\\u03c0 x 10^-7 T\\u00b7m/A. If I input the values I have\\u2014current of 5 A and radius of 4 m\\u2014I get B = (4\\u03c0 x 10^-7 * 5) / 8. This simplifies to about 7.85 x 10^-7 Tesla, which feels right. But using the tool\\u2019s default permeability of 0.01 gives a larger value of 0.00625 Tesla, and that doesn't match the physical expectation. This is puzzling!\\n**Preparing function call**\\n\\nThe instructions specify that I should only make function calls without extra text. I\\u2019ll use the function calculate_magnetic_field with a current of 5 A and a radius of 4 m. I realize I can also specify permeability, and I should use the accurate value for \\u03bc0, which is approximately 1.2566370614359173e-6 instead of the default 0.01. So, I'll set the call to functions.calculate_magnetic_field with current 5, radius 4, and permeability 1.25663706212e-6 for accuracy.\\n**Understanding function call instructions**\\n\\nThe developer clearly states that I should only return function calls in my response. After calling the tool, I'll need to handle the results, but I must stick to the guideline of just returning the function call. It's frustrating because I want to provide more context, but the instructions are strict. I understand the pattern: make the call, receive the tool result, and then respond with the final computed result.

However, I think the orchestrator can handle returning the tool result to the user afterward. Typically, I would have a commentary call followed by a final answer, but the instructions say to focus solely on the function.
