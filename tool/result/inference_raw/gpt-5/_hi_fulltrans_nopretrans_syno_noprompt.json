The user appears to ask when these ratifications occurred. The word \\\"\\u0905\\u0928\\u0941\\u0915\\u094d\\u0930\\u092e\\u0923\\\" could mean \\\"ratification.\\\" I have a function to get event dates, but it expects a single date, which might not suit a list of ratifications. Still, it's likely that I can retrieve key dates, like when the treaty was signed or when it entered into force.\\n**Deciding on event date retrieval**\\n\\nI think it's better to use the function get_event_date with specifics like \\\"Treaty of Lisbon entry into force\\\" or \\\"final ratification completion\\\" with a general location like \\\"EU\\\" or \\\"global.\\\" The function requires an event string, and while location is optional, it defaults to global, so we can easily call it with \\\"Lisbon Treaty accession.\\\" Yet, the tool may struggle with ambiguous events.
